# revision history
v.2.2.0 240318 changed (home) function to be sure motor is not past the PI position.  Added a step-back amount in case the current step is past the PI position.  
                move to home position at fast speed (max(user speed, 1200pps))
                changed backlash compensation when moving past PI location or min/max steps (moveRel)
    v.2.1.10-11 240201 fixed IRC state for consistency.  Changed in/out to (1|2) to match spec sheet
    v.2.1.9 240131 bug: chnaged IRCInit(), no longer creates a motor instance becuase it isn't requried for IRC.
